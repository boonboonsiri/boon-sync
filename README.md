### Warp

- Shortcuts
- Good terminal
- Smh why don't you sync

### Fig

- Upgrade terminal, sync aliases

### Shortcat -> I think just use default, global command pallete ie cmd + shift + space, can click on everything universally

: -> emojis
can also type name of app to open and close

### Rectangle -> control + option

- Window management, ie where on the screen something is, full screen, left screen, right screen,
  j, k, enter (full screen)

### Probably need a desktop window manager

### Karabiner -> Shortcuts

- main one is right command plus arrow keys, right option for mouse movements
- Caps lock -> hyper key
- right cmd + ijkl -> arrow keys
- right option + ijkl -> mouse, uo scroll, ; enter ' right click

### Amethyst for window managing????? -> might be useless, want it for focusing windows/more window management? -> ctrl + command (need to do this yourself boon, turn off setting for auto adjusting)

### Notion maybe?

### Yabai maybe? (doesn't really work, seems to need bsp mode on for features to work correctly (annoying as heck))

Turn on tililng: cmd + alt + s

Turn off tiling: cmd + alt + a


- Can allegely disable space animation: https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/434555/can-you-completely-disable-desktop-switching-animation-on-macos/434565#434565
- https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai/wiki/Commands#display-commands
- Rearrange spaces, delete and create spaces, move window to different space, move space to different displays
- turn on and off?
- also more easily install
- Can maybe also get rid of rectangle/amethyst (ametyhst is more automatic it seems so could be more useful)
- Yabai issue (focus/move/swap/create/destroy space) if don't disable thingy

## VSCODE

A lot of shortcuts to do
