## Development

### Warp
- Shortcuts
- Good terminal
- Smh why don't you sync

### Fig
- Upgrade terminal, sync aliases

### Shortcat -> I think just use default, global command pallete ie cmd + shift + space, can click on everything universally

### Rectangle -> control + option
- Window management, ie where on the screen something is, full screen, left screen, right screen, 

### Probably need a desktop window manager


### Karabiner -> Shortcuts
- main one is right command plus arrow keys, right option for mouse movements


### Amethyst for window managing?????

### Notion maybe?
